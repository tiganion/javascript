run with

a) npm run start   => simply starts up the server 
b) npm run watch   => starts up the server and watches for any changes and restarts it automatically
b) npx babel-node .\src\server.js => the above in the end are doing this call


There are some packageges:
* express -> the 'server'
* babel   -> transpiles code so node can run it (as ES6 syntax is not supported out of the box)
* bodyparse -> to be able to read body request (for POST)
* nodemon -> to have the server restarted automatically if there is change in the code
* eslint  -> checking the code
   ** npx eslint --init  -> to init eslint
   ** npx eslint .       -> to scan and analyze the code
   ** npx eslint . --fix -> to scan and attempt to fix minor issues
